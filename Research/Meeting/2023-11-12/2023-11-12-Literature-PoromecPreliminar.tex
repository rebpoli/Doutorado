\begin{itemize}
	\item Poroelastic solver (non linear to cope with fracture flow)
	\item Validated with Terzaghi and mandel solution
	\item Validating now fracture mechanics (working good so far...)
	\item Non-structured. gmsh generates the mesh
	\item Integrated to cmake and parallel computing in LNCC (sdumont)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10pt}
I am using the solver to a final project in geomechanics course.

The idea is to exercise homogeneization of mechanical and poroelastic parameters in a fractured media.

\item Considers simple geometries (spherical, cylindrical)
\item Mainly analytical work
\item Discusses the physics involved
\item Does not assess risks and geomechanics
\item Conclusions could be more clear "there are \textit{many} (...) technical challenges that still need ..." sounds too generic (which challenges?)

		\item Geomechanical study -- risk assessment.
		\item Proof of concept: can we abandon a well without cementing, just relying on natural closure after salt creep?
		\item 2D modelling of a well closure considering salt creep
		\item It seems to me that they used linear elastic, small strains FEM - which might not be good enough in this case
		\item Deviatoric stress up to 15MPa -- seems high to me, after creep

2D models, to consder cyclic loading, with fundamental creep and plasticity. Storage depths varying from 350 to 1350m. They claim the deeper is more mechanically unstable. They find the caverns are feasible.

Regarding formation of hydrogen plume (I could not completely understand the physics yet):
\begin{quote}
In addition to the hydromechanical modeqlling, an analysis of the
hydrogen extent within the rock mass is carried out. Since water and
hydrogen are immiscible, we assume hereafter that the threshold
capillary pressure of rock salt is much higher than hydrogen pressure
within the cavern due to the nanometric size of pore throats and hence
no free gas phase will be flowing. Assuming hydrogen is a non-reactive
solute (no chemical reaction or sorption with salt), we use the following
mass transport equation to delineate the extent and mass of dissolved
hydrogen plume. Transport of dissolved H2 is only driven by advection
(Darcyâ€™s law) and by diffusion, since mechanical dispersion is negligible
due to the low permeability of the porous medium.

\begin{frame}{The physics behind}
I see concern with geomechanical behavior, targeted to creep, collapse and tensile fracturing. The cyclic behavior of the pressure is a significant difference compared to oil drainage and waterflooding.
\begin{itemize}
\item Geomechanics: creep, thermal, tensile fracture, shear fractures
\item Chemical: dissolution
\item Cyclic operations
\item Temperature dependent creep
\item Plume extension ($H_2$ dissolved in water - percolation of $H_2$ in water saturated rock (?))
\item Heat transfer, especially considering cyclic operations
\item Well integrity
\end{itemize}
